</h1>

This is the Debian version of the Alpine-based bridge. [Read the instructions over there](https://github.com/renemarc/balena-airthingswave).

For reference, the resulting image weights around 400 MiB on a RaspBerry Pi, compared to about 120 MiB for Alpine. Compilation and update time is therefore compounded accordingly. I suggest that you use the Alpine version unless your hardware is not compatible.
